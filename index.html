        <h1>Refactoring</h1>
        <p>
          Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing
          body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its
          external behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations.
          Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a
          sequence of these transformations can produce a significant
          restructuring. Since each refactoring is small, it's less likely to go
          wrong. The system is kept fully working after each refactoring,
          reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken during the
          restructuring.
